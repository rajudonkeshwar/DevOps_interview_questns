1) Why by default ebs is attached to ec2 instance?
  Ans: When you launch an EC2 instance, it’s basically a virtual machine — and just like a physical computer, it needs storage to hold:
       the operating system (OS) (like Linux or Windows),
       application files, and
       data/logs.

       💡 So the main reason:
       Because every computer needs a disk to boot and store files, and EC2 uses EBS as that disk.
       Without EBS (or another root storage), the EC2 instance couldn’t even start — there’d be no where to install or run the OS from.

       Real-life examples:
       Running a database (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) on an EC2 — EBS stores the database files.
       Hosting a web server — OS, app code, and logs are stored on EBS.
       Backup or snapshot storage — You can take EBS snapshots for disaster recovery.

      Custom database setup
      You need full control over the database engine, version, or configuration (e.g., self-hosted MongoDB, Cassandra, or a specific MySQL build).
      Example: You install MongoDB on an EC2 instance → data is stored on an EBS volume.

      Non-relational databases
      RDS supports only relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
      For NoSQL DBs (like Elasticsearch, Redis, Cassandra), you use EC2 + EBS.
      
      Performance tuning
      You want direct control over the EBS volume type (e.g., io2 for very high IOPS)
      Useful for very high-performance or experimental workloads.
      
      Temporary or test databases
      Developers may spin up a quick EC2 + MySQL with EBS just for testing, without the overhead or cost of a managed RDS instance.

      When you create an RDS instance (say, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), AWS automatically allocates EBS volumes to store:
      Your database data files
      Transaction logs
      Automated backups and snapshots


2)  What is the snapshot for what purpose should we use, how do we take backup of ebs to other region?
Ans: 
    🧩 What is a snapshot in AWS?
        A snapshot is basically a backup copy of your EBS volume taken at a specific point in time.
        It captures all the data and settings of that volume so you can restore it later if needed.

    ⚙️ How it works:
      You have an EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance.
      You run Create Snapshot (manually or automatically through AWS Backup or Lifecycle Manager).
      AWS stores that snapshot in Amazon S3 (behind the scenes — you don’t manage it directly).
      The snapshot is incremental, meaning only changed data is saved after the first one (saves space and cost).

    🌍 About cross-region backup
    Yes — you should use snapshots to back up your EBS volumes to other regions if you want disaster recovery or geo-redundancy.
    
    You can:
    Create a snapshot in your current region.
    Copy that snapshot to another AWS region (manually or via automation).
    Restore a new EBS volume from that snapshot in the new region if needed.
    
    This helps if:
    A region has an outage.
    You want to migrate workloads to a different region.
    You want compliance with backup policies (e.g., offsite backup).

3) What is the main purpose of s3?
Ans: “Amazon S3 is mainly used for hosting static websites, storing backups, logs,  keeping large datasets, 
      hosting media files, and serving as a data lake for analytics and machine learning. 
      It’s reliable, scalable, and widely used across industries.”
      S3 is commonly used for automatic backups of files, databases, or entire systems.

      Yes, S3 is widely used to store logs because it provides durable, scalable, and low-cost storage.
      Logs can be from different sources — servers, applications, databases, or AWS services themselves.
      we can store .war, .jar files also

      Application Logs
      Server Logs / System Logs
      AWS Service Logs

4) What is a Load Balancer?
Ans: A load balancer is like a traffic police officer standing in front of your servers.
    When users send requests (for example, to your website), the load balancer distributes those requests evenly among multiple servers, 
    so no single server is overloaded.

      🧠 Key Points You Can Tell in Interview:
      It improves availability and fault tolerance — if one server goes down, the load balancer automatically sends traffic to the healthy ones.
      It improves scalability — you can add or remove servers behind the load balancer without users noticing.
      It ensures better performance — because it prevents any one server from being overwhelmed.


      ⚙️ 2️⃣ What are Target Groups?
      
      👉 Simple explanation:
      A Target Group is basically a collection of servers (targets) that the load balancer sends traffic to.
      Each target group contains one or more targets, which could be:
      EC2 instances
      Containers (like in ECS or EKS)
      Lambda functions
      The load balancer checks the health of targets in the group and only sends traffic to healthy ones.

      Target groups define how requests are routed — for example, based on path or host-based routing (/api vs /app).
      Health checks happen at the target group level.
      You can have multiple target groups under one load balancer — this allows microservices or multiple apps 
      to run behind a single load balancer.


      🚀 3️⃣ What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)?
      
      👉 Simple explanation:
      An Auto Scaling Group automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on your application's load or demand.

      🧠 Key Points You Can Say:
      It helps maintain performance and cost efficiency.
      You define minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances.
      It works based on scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms — e.g., if CPU > 70% for 5 minutes, add 2 more instances.
      It automatically replaces unhealthy instances (self-healing).

      
      4️⃣ How They Work Together (Load Balancer + Target Group + ASG)
      Here’s the full picture 👇
      Load Balancer (e.g., ALB) receives incoming traffic from users.
      It routes requests to the appropriate Target Group.
      The Target Group has EC2 instances that belong to an Auto Scaling Group.
      The Auto Scaling Group dynamically scales the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
      The Load Balancer automatically updates its target group with new instances as they are added or removed by the ASG.
      
      🗣 Short impressive explanation:
      
      “In AWS, the load balancer, target groups, and auto scaling groups work hand-in-hand — 
        the load balancer distributes traffic, the target group defines where it should go, 
        and the auto scaling group ensures that enough servers are always available to handle the load efficiently.”



5) ✅ Major Differences Between NACL and Security Groups
  Ans:
  1. Security Groups (SG)
  Work at instance level (EC2, ENI, RDS, ALB, etc.)
  Stateful → If you allow inbound, outbound is automatically allowed.
  Only allow rules (no deny rules)
  Easier to manage and commonly used.
  
  2. Network ACLs (NACLs)
  Work at subnet level
  Stateless → You must add both inbound AND outbound rules.
  Support allow and deny rules
  Used for an additional layer of security.
  
  ✅ When to Use Security Groups
  Use SGs when you want to control access to specific resources like EC2, RDS, ALB, EKS nodes, etc.
  Use cases for Security Groups:
  Allow only your application servers to access the database
  DB SG allows inbound only from App SG.

  Expose web server to the internet  
  Allow port 80/443 from anywhere.
  Restrict SSH access
  Allow port 22 only from your office IP or VPN.
  Security Groups are used almost every day and are your primary layer of firewall.



  ✅ When to Use NACLs
  
  Use NACLs when you need to control traffic at the subnet level or add an extra layer of network protection.
  Use cases for NACLs:  
  Block a specific IP address or range (Deny rule)
  NACL allows deny rules, SG doesn’t.
  Extra protection for public subnets
  Allow ports 80/443
  Block everything else.
  Protect private subnets from unwanted inbound traffic
  High-security environments where you want both SG + NACL for layered security.
  
  ✅ One-line Summary (perfect for interviews)  
  Security Groups are stateful firewalls applied to instances.
  NACLs are stateless firewalls applied to subnets.
  SGs allow rules only, NACLs allow and deny.
  Use SGs for daily resource protection, and NACLs for subnet-level filtering or blocking IPs.”
