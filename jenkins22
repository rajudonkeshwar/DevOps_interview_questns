1) What is a Jenkins pipeline?
ans: A pipeline is combination of steps writes it in a script, where we take care software development process through steps which includes
integration of the code from source, installing dependencies, running unit test cases, building and scaning the image, finally deploying it
in to dev or prod environment, instead of doing it manually, we can automate through CI-CD process using jenkins pipeline.


2) What is the difference between freestyle project and pipeline?
“In Jenkins we mainly have two approaches: Freestyle projects and Pipelines.
Freestyle is the traditional way, where we configure everything through the Jenkins UI. 
It’s simple and quick for small jobs, like pulling code from Git, running a build command, 
or archiving artifacts. But it has limitations — it’s not easy to handle complex workflows, 
parallel execution, or version control of the job itself.

On the other hand, Pipeline projects are more advanced and follow the concept of Pipeline as Code. 
Here, we define the entire CI/CD flow in a Jenkinsfile, which is stored in source control 
along with the application code. Pipelines are highly flexible, 
they support multiple stages, parallel builds, approvals, and can easily integrate with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.
So, in simple terms: I use Freestyle for small, one-off jobs, but for real-world CI/CD setups, 
I prefer Pipelines because they are maintainable, scalable, and version-controlled.”
