1))))   Let’s begin with the basics. What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source platform that facilitates configuration management, 
task automation, or application deployment. 
It is a valuable DevOps tool. It was written in Python and powered by Red Hat



2))))   Describe how Ansible works?
You can start this way - ansible is broken down into two types of servers: controlling machines and nodes. 
Ansible is installed on the controlling machines, and the controlling machines manage the nodes via SSH. 
The controlling machine contains an inventory file that holds the node system’s location. 
Ansible runs the playbook on the controlling machine to deploy the modules and the packages on the node systems. 
Since Ansible is agentless, there’s no need for a third-party tool to connect the nodes.



3))))  Explain what a “playbook” is?
A playbook is a YAML-based file which stores the commands to do the configuration in remote systems
Devops engineers can configure everything by passing the script to the required systems rather
than using individual commands to configure computers from the command line remotely.


- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Start Nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted

                


4))))  What is “idempotency”?
idempotency is an important Ansible feature. It prevents unnecessary changes in the managed hosts. 
With idempotency, you can execute one or more tasks on a server as many times as you can, 
but it won’t change anything that’s already been modified and it will give same output. 





5)))) What are roles in ansible?
In ansible roles are ways to arganize and structure your playbooks in a more reusable manner,
Roles simplify complex playbooks by grouping tasks, variables, files, templates, and handlers 
into a defined directory structure, that can easily shared and reused across different playbooks

  roles/
  <role_name>/
    tasks/
      main.yml          # Defines the list of tasks for the role
    handlers/
      main.yml          # Contains handlers triggered by tasks
    files/              
      # Static files to be copied to managed nodes
    templates/          
      # Jinja2 templates for dynamic file generation
    vars/
      main.yml          # Role-specific variables
    defaults/
      main.yml          # Default variables (overridable)
    meta/
      main.yml          # Role metadata (dependencies, etc.)
    tests/
      test.yml          # Test playbook for the role
    README.md           # Documentation for the role





6))))What are Handlers in Ansible?
In Ansible, handlers are special tasks that are executed only when they are explicitly "notified" by other tasks. 
They are primarily used to perform actions that should happen only after a change is made, 
such as restarting a service after modifying its configuration file.

                - name: Configure Apache
                  hosts: webservers
                  tasks:
                    - name: Install Apache
                      apt:
                        name: apache2
                        state: present
                
                    - name: Update Apache configuration
                      copy:
                        src: /path/to/httpd.conf
                        dest: /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
                      notify: Restart Apache
                
                  handlers:
                    - name: Restart Apache
                      service:
                        name: apache2
                        state: restarted


7)))) Define registers in ansible?
In Ansible, registers are used to capture and store the result of a task in a variable. 
These variables can be used in subsequent tasks, or debugging purposes. 
Registers are a crucial feature of Ansible that allow dynamic interaction with the environment being automated.

                - name: Check if a file exists
                  stat:
                    path: /path/to/file
                  register: file_status
                
                - name: Perform an action if the file exists
                  debug:
                    msg: "File exists!"
                  when: file_status.stat.exists




8)))) explain about setup module?

In Ansible, the setup module is a core module used to gather and retrieve detailed information about the target system. 
This information, often referred to as facts, includes system properties like IP addresses, operating system details, 
CPU architecture, memory, disk usage, and much more. 
These facts are stored as variables and can be used in subsequent tasks within the playbook.




9))))ansible_facts:::  ansible_facts is variable will stores the all the gathered information 
                        taken by ansible.builtin.setup module from remote server


		---
- name: Gather system facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Collect facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:

    - name: Display OS information
      debug:
        msg: "Host {{ inventory_hostname }} is running {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"


ansible all -m setup

{
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_hostname": "webserver01",
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": ["192.168.1.10"],
        "ansible_distribution": "Ubuntu",
        "ansible_distribution_version": "22.04",
        "ansible_memtotal_mb": 4096,
        "ansible_processor_vcpus": 2
    },
    "changed": false
}




10))) What are the components of Ansible?
      Answer:
      Inventory – Defines hosts and groups of servers.
      Modules – Predefined scripts for performing tasks (e.g., yum, apt, copy).
      Playbooks – YAML files defining automation workflows.
      Roles – Reusable playbooks with tasks, handlers, and templates.
      Facts – System information collected from managed nodes.
      Handlers – Special tasks triggered by changes.
	  Registers - registers are used to capture and store the result of a task in a variable


11))) What is Ansible Vault?
  Ansible Vault is a security feature in Ansible that allows you to encript and protect sensitive information 
  like passwords, API keys, SSH keys, and confidential configuration files. 
  This ensures that secret data is not exposed in playbooks, Git repositories, or while sharing files with a team.
  
  1. Creating a New Encrypted File
         **ansible-vault create secrets.yml**
		 **ansible-vault view secrets.yml**
		 **ansible-vault edit secrets.yml**
     You’ll be asked to enter a password.
     The file will open in an editor (e.g., Vim or Nano).
     Add sensitive data inside and save it.
     The file is now encrypted and can only be accessed with the correct password.
  
  2. Decrypting a File
  If you need to convert an encrypted file back to plaintext:
          **ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml**
  
  3. Edit an encrypted file:
          **ansible-vault edit secrets.yml**

  4. use vault file in a playbook
              vars_files:
              - secrets.yml

  5. If a playbook references an encrypted file, Ansible will ask 
     for the vault password when running:
          **ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass**

    You can do configuration in configuration file by addind as **ask_vault_pass = True**
        so that it will ask for password when you are entering the command

	But it is not good practice to give passwords of encryption manually, in automated environments you can store
	passwords anywhere in the server and use below command
	ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mysql.yaml --vault-password-file /home/ec2-user/mysql_vault_pass



12)))) Difference Between command and shell Modules in Ansible

      Ansible provides two similar modules for running commands on remote machines:
      command module
      shell module
      Both modules are used to execute system commands, but they have important differences 
      in how they handle commands, especially regarding shell features like pipes (|), 
      redirections (>, <), and variables ($HOME, $(command), &&, ||).

      =====command Module========
      The command module is safer because it executes commands directly without invoking a shell (/bin/sh or /bin/bash).
      ✅ Key Features of command Module
      ✔️ More secure – does not allow shell operators (like |, &&, ;)
      ✔️ Faster – since it avoids loading a full shell environment
      ✔️ Works well for running simple system commands
      example:
          - name: List files in /tmp directory
            ansible.builtin.command: ls /tmp


      =======shell Module========
      The shell module executes commands through a shell (/bin/sh or /bin/bash), 
      allowing shell features like pipes, redirections, and variables.
      ✅ Key Features of shell Module
      ✔️ Supports pipes (|), redirections (>, <), and command chaining (&&, ||)
      ✔️ Supports environment variable expansion ($HOME, $(command))
      ✔️ Can execute scripts or inline shell commands
      examples:
          - name: Count files in /tmp using shell
            ansible.builtin.shell: ls /tmp | wc -l

      Key Takeaway
      Use command whenever possible for better security and performance.
      Use shell only if you need shell features like pipes, redirection, or variable expansion.


13)))  How do you use loops in Ansible?
       Loops allow you to run a task multiple times for different input
       - name: Install multiple packages
         apt:
            name: "{{ item }}"
            state: present
         loop:
            - nginx
            - git
            - curl



Command syntax via remote connection:
Nginx s/w install:
Syntax: ansible all -i <IP address>, -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> -b -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed"
Service restart:
Syntax: ansible all -i <IPAddress>, -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=started"
Ansible Modules: (for installations)
Ansible.builtin.debug:  print the message
Ansible.builtin.package: used for software installation in any linux server
Ansible.builtin.ping: pinging for testing connection between two servers
ansible.builtin.file: It is used to create file or directory
ansible.builtin.get_url: Used to download the code form URL

ansible.builtin.get_url:
	url:<link>
	dest: /tmp/frontend.zip

ansible.builtin.unarchive:( It is used to unzip the code ) 
	src: /tmp/frontend.zip
	dest: /usr/share/nginx/html
	remote_src: yes

ansible.builtin.copy:
ansible.builtin.user:

Q: What is Ad hoc commands in Ansible?
Ans: On emergency request or any unpredictable situations, we can perform software configuration in servers using ad Hoc commands instead of playbooks.
Syn: ansible all -i <IP address>, -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> -m ping

Q: How can we utilize the declared variable in a playbook?
Ans: using double braces i.e., {{ <variable name> }}
Note: Variable declared under "vars" can be used globally inside a playbook
 - name: variables
  hosts: local
  connection: local
  vars: # PLAY level variables
    COURSE: "DevOps with AWS"
    DURATION: 120HRS
    TRAINER: Sivakumar
  tasks:
  - name: print the variable
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "Course is {{ COURSE }}, Duration is {{ DURATION }}, Trainer is {{ TRAINER }}"


Q: How many ways can be passed variables in a playbook?
Ans: Multiple ways can be passed . They are
	• Command line or argument ( ansible-playbook site.yml -e "package_name=nginx service_name=nginx" )

	• Task level / local variables
		---
		- name: Install web server
		  hosts: webservers
		  vars:
		    package_name: nginx
		  tasks:
		    - name: Install package
		      apt:
		        name: "{{ package_name }}"
		        state: present

	• Variables from another YAML file
			
				📁 vars.yml
			
			package_name: httpd
			service_name: httpd
			
			
			📄 playbook.yml
			
			---
			- name: Install web server
			  hosts: webservers
			  vars_files:
			    - vars.yml
			  tasks:
			    - name: Install package
			      yum:
			        name: "{{ package_name }}"
			        state: present


	• Variables from prompt

				---
				- name: Deploy Application
				  hosts: all
				  vars_prompt:
				    - name: app_version
				      prompt: "Enter the application version to deploy"
				  tasks:
				    - debug:
				        msg: "Deploying version {{ app_version }}"


	• Play level / Global variables

	• Variables from Inventory

			📁 inventory.ini
			
			[webservers]
			web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 app_port=8080
			web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 app_port=9090
			
			
			📄 In your playbook:
			
			- name: Print app port
			  hosts: webservers
			  tasks:
			    - debug:
			        msg: "App running on port {{ app_port }}"

	• Roles:
			When using roles, you can define variables in two special places:
			roles/rolename/defaults/main.yml → lowest precedence (default values)
			roles/rolename/vars/main.yml → higher precedence (hardcoded for role)

			✅ Example:
			
			📁 roles/webserver/defaults/main.yml
			package_name: nginx
			
			📁 roles/webserver/tasks/main.yml
			- name: Install web package
			  apt:
			    name: "{{ package_name }}"
			    state: present



Q: What is ansible facts? What is the use of it?
Ans: ansible_facts is the data fetch from node server which includes entire server data.
We can use those data for identify the state of the server, filter data for our requirement.

Q: What are the predefined functions to convert list into map or vice-versa?
Ans:
Items2dict  --> conversion of list into dictionary(map)
Dict2items  --> conversion of dictionary(map) to list items

Q: What is the ansible command to validate IP address?
Ans: ansible.utils.ipaddr

	- name: Validate IP
	  hosts: localhost
	  gather_facts: false
	  vars:
	    my_ip: "192.168.1.10"
	  tasks:
	    - name: Check if IP is valid
	      debug:
	        msg: "{{ my_ip | ansible.utils.ipaddr }}"

		🟢 Output:

		ok: [localhost] => {
			"msg": "192.168.1.10"
		}
		
		
		✅ Returns the IP if valid
		❌ Throws an error if invalid


Q: How can we perform configuration of the server if we don't have ansible modules?
Ans: We can either use shell( less secure i.e., similar to shell redirections, pipes etc)  
	or command modules(more secure i.e., will execute via remote due to lack of access)

Q:How can we redirect the output in Ansible?
Ans: ansible.builtin.shell
	ansible.builtin.command using register keyword

Q:How can we create files/directory using Ansible?
Ans:  ansible.builtin.file module. We can do CRUD on either file or directory using this module

Q: Can we run any playbook without inventory.ini?
Ans: If ansible.cfg is present in the current directory where you were executing playbooks, then no need to mention 
	 "inventory.ini" specifically in the command prompt.

Q: How can we execute libraries in more than one server?
Ans:  ansible.builtin.pip  (executables: "pip3.9")  --> Used to install/configure dependencies/libraries of the tasks (for Python)
	ansible.builtin.template --> Install/Configure for the PLAYBOOK tasks

Q: What is the module that used for CRUD operations on a specific user?
Ans: ansible.builtin.user: manage user accounts and user attributes.(for Windows:  ansible.windows.win_user)

Q: How can we download the specific content during runtime required for the PLAY tasks?
Ans: ansible.builtin.get_url  --> Download backend code

Q: What is the module that we used for extract the application package?
Ans: ansible.builtin.unarchive --> unzip the backend code

Q: How can we execute shell commands in Ansible?
Ans: ansible.builti.command  --> using this commands(shell) can be executable

Q: How can we copy dependencies required for application server configuration?
Ans: ansible.builtin.copy  --> We can copy the file from local/source to destination/specified directory

Q: How can we achieve particular service needs to restart/start/enable ?
Ans: ansible.builtin.service --> We can restart/enable the services required for the application to be up

Q: What are tags in ansible? Why we can use the same?
Ans: We can control few tasks using "tags". By "tags", we can execute the mentioned tasks 
	only during execution (instead of running tasks everytime execution)
				---
			- name: Web Server Setup
			  hosts: webservers
			  become: yes
			  tasks:
			    - name: Install nginx
			      apt:
			        name: nginx
			        state: present
			      tags: 
			        - install
			
			    - name: Configure nginx
			      template:
			        src: nginx.conf.j2
			        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
			      tags: 
			        - config

		ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "install"
		🔹 Only the “Install nginx” task runs.
		Syntax: ansible-playbook <playbook.yaml> --tags "tag name>

Q: What is Ansible Roles? Why we can use?
Ans: A standard structure of writing playbooks that contains tasks, variables, dependencies, files, templates, l
		ibraries, handlers and other ansible artifacts and make these are reusable in different use cases.
Roles ---> tasks(main.yaml)  --> Specified instructions for the defined action/task to implement
	---> files (bar.txt, foo.sh etc)--> This file consists of the application image related service or script files with copy of resources
	---> handlers (main.yaml)  --> This is notifier script file (notify) will perform action when there is change event
	---> templates (ntp.conf.j2) --> These are the script files consists of dependencies of the defined tasks under a particular role. Through this, we can change variable values during run time
	---> vars(main.yaml)  --> This file consists variables which are defined , required for the action tasks
	---> meta(main.yaml)  --> This is script file consists of role dependencies, custom modules
	---> defaults (main.yaml)  --> default lower priority variables for the specified role
	---> library --> This is the file consists of required libraries cryptography, PyMysql for configuring MYSQL DB
	---> module_utils --> Roles can also include custom module utils
	---> lookup_plugins --> plugins for the software configuration

Q: How to skip the tags in Ansible?
Ans: 
	When you run an Ansible playbook, by default, all tasks execute (unless restricted by conditions).
	But sometimes, you want to avoid running certain tasks — for example, configuration or restart steps.

	ansible-playbook <playbook-name>.yml --skip-tags "<tag1>,<tag2>"
			
				---
			- name: Web Server Setup
			  hosts: webservers
			  become: yes
			
			  tasks:
			    - name: Install nginx
			      apt:
			        name: nginx

			      service:
			        name: nginx
			        state: restarted
			      tags:
			        - restart
	ansible-playbook web.yml --skip-tags "config"
	Here config named tag task is skipped

Q: How can we store the password in Ansible or What is the best practice for handling sensitive info in Ansible?
Ans: Using "ansible-vault " , we can store sensitive info like usernames, root password, ip address etc
	Syntax: Create  -->  ansible-vault create <vault-filename.yaml>
		    View    -->  ansible-vault view <vault-filename.yaml>
		    Edit      -->  ansible-vault edit <vault-filename.yaml>
	Note: We need to enter password (it will ask in command prompt)  while creating, listing, editing vault files
	
Q: How do we execute playbook if we have vault?
Ans: ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini <playbookname.yaml> --ask-vault-pass
Note: Call respective vault file and prompting vault password for accessing sensitive info
Alternate method: Maintain vault file separately in server( instead Github)
		ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini <playbook.yaml> --vault-password-file <vault file path>
Alternate method: (To avoid password enetering during prompt)
	ask_vault_pass = True Should be in ansible.cfg file (This method is applicable if the password file in the GITHUB )
	vault_password_file = <path> (This method is applicable if we maintain password file in the server)
Advanced version of Ansible vault is AWS secret Manager or Parameter Store
Decoupling Code and configuration i.e., playbooks in code where as sensitive info maintaining as a configuration in AWS(since AWS is PAAS)
Step 1: Creating AWS security system parameter using "secure string" in AWS
Step 2: Calling/fetching those configured parameter in our playbook whereever sensitive info required
	login_password: "{{ lookup( 'amazon.aws.aws_ssm', '/expense/mysql/mysql_root_password', decrypt=True) }}"

Q: What way we can achieve server provisioning across hybrid cloud environments and deploying applications as part of workflows?
Ans: Ansible tower is web-based UI and Rest API developed by RedHat for managing and controlling Ansible Automation. 
It acts as an enterprise-level framework on top of the open-source Ansible engine and provides additional features 
that make easier to scale, secure and manage your automation workflows.
Use Cases:
	1) Automating server provisioning across hybrid cloud environments
	2) Deploying applications with approval workflows and human intervention
	3) Managing user access to sensitive infrastructure actions
	4) Scheduling patch management across thousands of servers.
