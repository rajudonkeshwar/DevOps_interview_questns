1) What is Docker File?
  Docker file is a file it has docker instructions to create our own images, this file declarative in nature means
  what we writes we will get it

2) What is the Docker?
  Docker is the containerization platform and it is used to manage the lifecycle of containers,
  I use docker basically, write some docker files, build the docker images, runs some docker containers, push them to ECR

3) How containers are different from virtual machines?
Ans: Continers are very lightweight in nature, because they dont have complete OS, It is basically combination of your application
      its dependencies, some libraries which are requird to run your application
     Where as Virtual Machines has complete guest OS, we all know operating systems are very heavy, and it has very OSImage.

4) What is docker Lifecycle?
Ans: The docker life cycle is nothing but, writing a docker file, building docker image, pushing them to ECR
    In my case what i usually do is i start with writing a dockerfile, lets say development team was approched me, i will initially
    start with writing a docker file, in the docker file i will write set -of -instructions, that are required to run the application
    Once i feel the docker file is complete, i will create image out of it by running docker build command, which will essentially convert
    your docker files to docker images
    After that you can use docker run command to execute your container, Finally you push the image to docker registry
