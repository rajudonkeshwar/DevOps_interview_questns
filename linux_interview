2))))) FIND COMMAND
The find command in Linux/Unix is a powerful utility used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy. 
It allowing users to locate files 
based on various criteria like name, type, size, permissions, and modification time.

Examples:
find /path/to/search -iname "filename.txt"

find /home/user -type d

find /home/user -type d/f -size +100M

find /path/to/search -type d/f -size +100M -mtime -7

find /path/to/search -type d/f -size +100M -mtime -7 -perm 777 -name ".log"



3)))) SED COMMAND
The sed command, short for stream editor, is a tool used in Linux/Unix to quickly find and modify text in files or data streams.
Replace one word with another
Delete unwanted lines (e.g., remove all empty lines).
Add or insert text in specific places (e.g., add "Hello" before every line containing "World").

sed 's/cat/dog/g' file.txt
Replace all occurrences of cat with dog:

sed 's/cat/dog/gi' file.txt
Replace cat with dog, case-insensitively:

sed '3d' file.txt
deleting the third line

sed '/error/d' file.txt
deleting the lines containing word with error

sed '2,5d' file.txt
deleting the lines from second to fifth

sed -n '/hello/p' file.txt
Print lines containing hello

sed -n '5p' file.txt
prints the 5th line

sed '/world/i Hello' file.txt
Insert Hello before lines containing world

sed '2,4s/foo/bar/' file.txt
Replace foo with bar between the 2nd and 4th lines:



4>>>> AWK COMMAND ===>
The awk command is like a text editor tool for quickly working with text or data in files. 
It reads text line by line, splits each line into columns (called "fields"),

Print specific columns (like getting names or ages from a table).
Search for lines that match certain words or patterns.
Perform calculations, like adding up numbers in a column.

awk '{ print $0 }' file.txt
prints entire file

awk '{ print $1, $3 }' file.txt
(Prints the 1st and 3rd fields of each line.)

awk '/error/ { print $0 }' file.txt
(print lines containing error)

$cat > employee.txt 
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000

$ awk '{print}' employee.txt
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000

$ awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt 
ajay manager account 45000
varun manager sales 50000

$ awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt 
ajay 45000
sunil 25000

$ awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt 
ajay 45000
sunil 25000


5>>>>  what is linux and how is it different from unix ?
linux and unix are both strong operating systems,
Linux is a free open source widely used in personal computers to servers, even smart phones
It is constantly improved by a large community of developers which means fast updates and bug fixes

UNIX in the other hand proprietary system, mainly used in enterprises like large servers and workstations
because it is not a open source and you need a license to use it, updates tend to be slower 


6>>>> What is linux kernel? why is it important?
The linux kernel like a brain of the linux o/s, it is the core part that connects your hardware and software
managing key sources like  a cpu, memory devices, to keep everythig and running smoothly.
it handles important tasks like handling multiple programs at once, organizing files and storages
managing network communication, kernel is the medium between hardware and software.


7>>> What is a SHELL in linux and how is it different from BASH?
In linux shell is basically a command-line-interface that lets you interact with o/s,
It is like a bridge between you and system kernel, it takes commands you typed, interprets them, executes them
shell gives some features like scripting, command history, which help you automate tasks manage proceses more efficiently.

BASH>> It is one of the most commanly used shell, and comes with better scripting tools, command line editing
    if you are looking for something  powerfull and user friendly scripting and command line tasks bash is the great choice


8>>> What are the basic components of a linux OS?
      The linux ha mainly five components
      1. Kernel
      The core of the Linux OS that manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, devices), software resources.
      Handles process scheduling, file systems, networking, and inter-process communication.
      
      2. System libraries
      System libraries, also known as shared libraries, are pre-written code that allows 
      applications to access the Linux operating system's features. 
      They act as a bridge between the kernel and applications. 
      
      3. System Utilities
      System utilities are programs that help manage and maintain a computer's performance. 
      They are a type of system software that work with the operating system to optimize a computer's functionalityExamples:
      Process Management: ps, top, kill
      File Management: ls, cp, mv, rm, find
      Network Management: ping, ifconfig, netstat, ssh
      User Management: passwd, adduser, whoami, groups

      4.File system
      A Linux file system is a way to organize and manage files on a Linux operating system. 
      It defines how data is stored, accessed, and retrieved on a disk.
      Common file systems: ext4, XFS, Btrfs, ZFS


      5.Bootloader:
      The bootloader is a program that is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory.


9>>> What is Init process?
      The init (short for "initialization") process is the first process that runs when a Linux system boots. 
      It is responsible for initializing the system, setting up the user environment, and managing system processes.
      init is started by the kernel once it loads into memory.
      It runs with Process ID (PID) 1, making it the parent of all other processes.
      It remains running throughout the system's uptime and is responsible for starting, monitoring, and stopping system processes.

      Its main job is to setup the system and manages everything that runs after booting


10>>> what is soft link?
      A soft link, also known as a symbolic link (symlink), is a special type of file in Linux 
      that acts as a pointer to another file or directory. 
      It does not contain the actual data of the target file but instead stores the path to it.

      Key Characteristics of Soft Links
      ✅ Soft links can point to files or directories.
      ✅ Can span across different file systems or partitions.
      ✅ The file size of a soft link is small (only stores the path).
      ✅ If the original file is deleted, the soft link stops working (broken link).

      ex:: ln -s <target-file> <soft-link-name>
      l rwx rwx rwx 1 user user 10 Feb 1 10:00 link.txt -> original.txt
      l at the begining indicates softlink
      unlink link.txt  =======> removing of softLink


11>>> what is hard link (detailed explanation)
      A hard link is a direct reference to the data blocks of an existing file on disk. 
      Unlike a soft link (symbolic link), a hard link acts as another name for the same file. 
      If the original file is deleted, the hard link still retains the data because both share the same inode number.
