2))))) FIND COMMAND
The find command in Linux/Unix is a powerful utility used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy. 
It allowing users to locate files 
based on various criteria like name, type, size, permissions, and modification time.

Examples:
find /path/to/search -iname "filename.txt"

find /home/user -type d

find /home/user -type d/f -size +100M

find /path/to/search -type d/f -size +100M -mtime -7

Replace one word with another
Delete unwanted lines (e.g., remove all empty lines).
Add or insert text in specific places (e.g., add "Hello" before every line containing "World").

sed 's/cat/dog/g' file.txt
Replace all occurrences of cat with dog:

sed 's/cat/dog/gi' file.txt
Replace cat with dog, case-insensitively:

sed '3d' file.txt

5>>>>  what is linux and how is it different from unix ?
linux and unix are both strong operating systems,
Linux is a free open source widely used in personal computers to servers, even smart phones
It is constantly improved by a large community of developers which means fast updates and bug fixes

UNIX in the other hand proprietary system, mainly used in enterprises like large servers and workstations
because it is not a open source and you need a license to use it, updates tend to be slower 


6>>>> What is linux kernel? why is it important?
The linux kernel like a brain of the linux o/s, it is the core part that connects your hardware and software
managing key sources like  a cpu, memory devices, to keep everythig and running smoothly.
it handles important tasks like handling multiple programs at once, organizing files and storages
managing network communication, kernel is the medium between hardware and software.


7>>> What is a SHELL in linux and how is it different from BASH?
In linux shell is basically a command-line-interface that lets you interact with o/s,
It is like a bridge between you and system kernel, it takes commands you typed, interprets them, executes them
shell gives some features like scripting, command history, which help you automate tasks manage proceses more efficiently.

BASH>> It is one of the most commanly used shell, and comes with better scripting tools, command line editing
    if you are looking for something  powerfull and user friendly scripting and command line tasks bash is the great choice


8>>> What are the basic components of a linux OS?
      The linux ha mainly five components
      1. Kernel
      The core of the Linux OS that manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, devices), software resources.
      Handles process scheduling, file systems, networking, and inter-process communication.
      
      2. System libraries
      System libraries, also known as shared libraries, are pre-written code that allows 
      applications to access the Linux operating system's features. 
      They act as a bridge between the kernel and applications. 
      
      3. System Utilities
      System utilities are programs that help manage and maintain a computer's performance. 
      They are a type of system software that work with the operating system to optimize a computer's functionalityExamples:
      Process Management: ps, top, kill
      File Management: ls, cp, mv, rm, find
      Network Management: ping, ifconfig, netstat, ssh
      User Management: passwd, adduser, whoami, groups

      4.File system
      A Linux file system is a way to organize and manage files on a Linux operating system. 
      It defines how data is stored, accessed, and retrieved on a disk.
      Common file systems: ext4, XFS, Btrfs, ZFS


      5.Bootloader:
      The bootloader is a program that is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory.


9>>> What is Init process?
      The init (short for "initialization") process is the first process that runs when a Linux system boots. 
      It is responsible for initializing the system, setting up the user environment, and managing system processes.
      init is started by the kernel once it loads into memory.
      It runs with Process ID (PID) 1, making it the parent of all other processes.
      It remains running throughout the system's uptime and is responsible for starting, monitoring, and stopping system processes.

      Its main job is to setup the system and manages everything that runs after booting


10>>> what is soft link?
      A soft link, also known as a symbolic link (symlink), is a special type of file in Linux 
      that acts as a pointer to another file or directory. 
      It does not contain the actual data of the target file but instead stores the path to it.

      Key Characteristics of Soft Links
      ✅ Soft links can point to files or directories.
      ✅ Can span across different file systems or partitions.
      ✅ The file size of a soft link is small (only stores the path).
      ✅ If the original file is deleted, the soft link stops working (broken link).

      ex:: ln -s <target-file> <soft-link-name>
      l rwx rwx rwx 1 user user 10 Feb 1 10:00 link.txt -> original.txt
      l at the begining indicates softlink
      unlink link.txt  =======> removing of softLink


11>>> what is hard link (detailed explanation)
      A hard link is a direct reference to the data blocks of an existing file on disk. 
      Unlike a soft link (symbolic link), a hard link acts as another name for the same file. 
      If the original file is deleted, the hard link still retains the data because both share the same inode number.

      When you create a hard link, a new directory entry (filename) is created, 
      but it points to the same inode (data location) as the original file.
      Both the original file du -sh /path/to/directoryand the hard link share the same data.
      Modifying one modifies the other because they point to the same physical storage blocks.
      Deleting one does not delete the other because the inode and data remain intact until all hard links are removed.

      example:::
      ln <target-file> <hard-link-name>
      ln original.txt hardlink.tx

      Use the ls -li command to verify wheter two files linked or not, the main indication is files Inode number


12>>> How do you check your IP address in Linux?
      ip a ; ifconfig, hostname -i
      To check external IP you can use
      curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com


13>>> How would you check the disk usage of a specific directory in Linux?
      This command will show the total size of the specified directory and its contents.
      du -sh /path/to/directory


14>>> How can you determine which process is using a specific port on a Linux system?
      The netstat -lntp command is used to list listening TCP ports along with the process (PID) that opened them.
      
      netstat -lntp | grep ":80"
      Finds processes listening on port 80 (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
      netstat -lntp | grep ":8080"
      Shows which process is using port 8080, so you can stop or reconfigure it.
      ss -lntp
      << Alternativly we can use this command >>



15>>> What is the purpose of the chmod command, and how do you use it?
      The chmod command is used to change the file system permissions of files and directories. 
      Permissions are defined for the owner, group, and others, and they determine the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) access.

      chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+r file.tx                                        
      u: User (owner).                           r: Read permission.                         
      g: Group.                                  w: Write permission.
      o: Others.                                 x: Execute permission.
      +: Adds the specified permissions.
      chmod 755 file.txt


16>>> What is an Inode?
      An inode (Index Node) is a data structure used by Linux and UNIX file systems to store metadata 
      about a file or directory. Every file and directory in a Linux file system is assigned a unique inode number.
      Inodes do not store the file name or data; they store only metadata and pointers to the actual data blocks.
      The inode points to data blocks where the file content is stored.

      You can check the inode number of a file using the ls -i command:
      ls -i file.txt


17>>> what is file-system in linux?
      File systems are a crucial part of any operating system, provides a structured way 
      to store, organize, and manage data on storage devices such as hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives. 
      Essentially, a file system acts as a bridge between the operating system and the physical storage hardware, 
      allowing users and applications to create, read, update, and delete files in an organized and efficient manner.
      Ex.. NTFS, EXT4, FAT


18>>> How can we attach volume to the instance in aws, and what process should we follow after we did it?
      First take any device such as sdf, sdg, sdh, it may renamed as xvdf, xvdg, xvdh
      Than attach it to ec2 instance, and check whether it is attached or not using 
                          *lsblk* or fdisk -l
      Check if it’s formatted: if the output is data it needs to be formatted( formatting nothing but whether it has file system or not)
                          sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
      Format as ext4:
                          sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
      Mounting the Volume
      Create a mount point:
                          sudo mkdir /opt/mount_myvolume
      Mount the disk:
                          sudo mount /dev/xvdf /opt/mount_myvolume
      verify:
                          df -h




19>>> Explanation about du -sh, df -h, and free -h Commands in Linux?
      du -sh>>>
      The du (Disk Usage) command estimates the space used by files and directories. The options -sh modify its behavior.

      df -h>>>
      The df (Disk Filesystem) command shows available and used disk space for mounted filesystems.

      free -h>>>
      The free command shows system memory usage, including RAM and swap space.

                        Command	Purpose
      du -sh	    Shows the total disk space used by a specific directory.
      df -h	      Displays the disk space usage of mounted filesystems.
      free -h	    Shows memory (RAM and swap) usage.




20>>> Difference between lsblk and df -h command?

      1. df -h (Disk Filesystem Usage)
        The df (Disk Filesystem) command reports the disk space usage of mounted filesystems. 
        df -h
        Shows disk usage of mounted partitions only.
        Displays filesystem size, used space, available space, and mount points.
        Does not show unmounted partitions or detailed device hierarchy.

      2. lsblk (List Block Devices)
        The lsblk command lists all storage devices (block devices) in a tree format, 
        including unmounted partitions.
        lsblk
        Shows all block devices, including unmounted partitions.
        Displays device names (sda, sdb), partition names (sda1, sda2), sizes, and types.
        Does not show filesystem usage (used/free space).
        Shows disk hierarchy (e.g., which partitions belong to which disks).



21>>>  Explain about nslookup command?

        It is a command line used to query DNS servers, for domain name and ip-address mapping
        whether domain name is mapped properly or not.



22>>> Define DNS records?

        Theses are the entries in the dns database that maps domain names to specific resources
            A        ====== maps domain, sub domain to ipv4 address
            AAAA     ====== maps domain(sub domain) to ipv6 address
            CNAME    ====== points domain or subdomain to another domain name
