1) How do we expalin about our DevOps project in interview?
Ans: I am working in amazon where i support multiple development teams some of them are payments, transcactions,
     their applications have written in java so i support them as a devops engineer helping them in creating the cicd
     pipelines, deploying their application on to the eks cluster through CICD pipeline, creating resources for them in aws using terraform
     managing the configurations of their virtual machines usig ansible.




2) Tell me day to day activities of you as a devops engineer?
Ans:   Lets say there is a amazon called organization, with in the organization usually there will be multiple projects
    like payment, transcactions, xyz.., and for each this there will be a dedicated development team, they will manage
    their assigned project, but when you comes to devops teams, devops team are usually centralized, that means one or 
    couple of devops teams who can manage multiple projects, that is the reason why devops teams receving a lot of requests
    on daily bases, beacuse you are not working for a single project, you are working for a multiple projects
    How does multiple projects create requets to the devops team this is might our question
      The real answer is starts from here

    lets say there is payment project payment development team needs a kubernetes cluster, so what do they do is, they will approach
    the devops team they will asks the devops team that can you create a kubernetes cluster, transcaction team might need help of you
    for creating some infrastructure on aws using terraform, other team create request for you create github, webhook, so these are some
    examples, but how do they create requestso what happens is in organization usually there will be some project management tools such
    as zera, or serrviceNow, these development teams goes to the zera dash board, they will naviagte to the project zera of devops team
    and they will create a request for kubernetes cluster or creating some resources using terraform, once the devops engineer logs to the
    zera dash board they will see the list of zera tickets, that they have to work on
