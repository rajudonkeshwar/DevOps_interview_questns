Can you explain the core principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)?

Interview Answer (as the interviewee):

“Yes. CI/CD is all about automating and improving the way we build, test, and deliver applications.

Continuous Integration (CI) means developers frequently commit their code to a shared repository. 
  Every commit automatically triggers a build and tests. This helps us detect issues early, reduce integration problems, and maintain code quality.

Continuous Delivery (CD) means that once the code passes all tests and quality checks, 
  it is automatically prepared for deployment. The application is always in a deployable state, 
  and deployments to environments like dev, QA, or staging are automated. Production deployment can be done with a manual approval if required.

The core principles of CI/CD are automation, fast feedback, consistency, and reliability.
These principles help us release changes faster, with fewer errors, and with more confidence.”
