How do you use Terraform in your environment?
Ans:
  “We use Terraform mainly for provisioning and managing our cloud infrastructure. All our resources—like VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, 
  load balancers, and databases—are defined as code. This helps us keep everything consistent across environments.
  We store our Terraform code in Git, so any change goes through code review. We use remote state (S3 + DynamoDB or Terraform Cloud) to keep state locked and shared. 
  For deployments, we run Terraform through a CI/CD pipeline, which handles plan and apply steps.
  Overall, Terraform helps us automate infrastructure creation, track changes, avoid manual errors, and easily reproduce environments.”


How will you utilize Terraform modules and perform version upgrades in your environment?
Ans:
  “We use Terraform modules to keep our infrastructure code organized and reusable. For example, we have separate modules for networking, compute, databases, and security. 
  Instead of writing the same code again and again, we just call the module with different inputs. This helps us maintain consistency across all environments.
  For version upgrades, we follow a controlled process. First, we upgrade the module or provider version in a feature branch. 
  Then we run terraform init -upgrade and check the plan to see what changes will happen. 
  We test the upgrade in a lower environment like dev or staging to make sure nothing breaks. 
  Once everything looks good, we merge the changes into the main branch and apply them through our CI/CD pipeline.
  This approach helps us safely roll out module updates, provider upgrades, and Terraform version changes without impacting production.”



What security, autoscaling, and scalability approaches are you using in your current setup?
Ans:
  “In our setup, we follow a few key approaches for security, autoscaling, and overall scalability.
  For security, we use things like security groups, network ACLs, IAM roles, and encryption for data at rest and in transit. 
  We keep everything private as much as possible, use least-privilege access, and follow regular patching and monitoring. 
  We also use tools like CloudWatch/GuardDuty/SIEM (depending on company) for alerts.

  For autoscaling, we use Auto Scaling Groups for our compute resources and scale based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. 
  For containerized workloads, we use ECS/EKS/Kubernetes autoscaling policies. This helps us automatically increase or decrease resources based on load.

  For scalability, we design everything to be fully distributed and stateless where possible. 
  We use load balancers at the front, managed services like RDS/ElastiCache/queues, and keep infrastructure modular so we can easily add more nodes when required. 
  This helps us handle high traffic without performance issues.

  Overall, our goal is to stay secure, reduce manual work, and ensure the system can scale smoothly as demand grows.”




Can you give some instances where you used Ansible?
Ans:
   “I’ve used Ansible in several practical situations:
   Server configuration: I used Ansible playbooks to install packages, configure services, set up users, and manage system settings on Linux servers. 
   This helped us keep all servers consistent.
  Application deployment: I automated deployment steps like pulling code, updating config files, restarting services, and managing environment variables. This reduced manual errors.
  Patching and updates: I used Ansible to apply security patches and OS updates across multiple servers at once without logging into each machine.
  Provisioning after Terraform: After Terraform created the infrastructure, I used Ansible to configure the machines—for example, installing Docker, Nginx, or application dependencies.
  CI/CD integration: Ansible was used in our pipeline to push configuration changes or deploy new builds automatically.
  These use cases helped us save time, avoid manual work, and maintain consistent configurations across environments.”
