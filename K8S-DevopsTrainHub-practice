1) How to safely drain a kubernetes nodes?
Ans: Safely draining a Kubernetes node means evicting all non-daemonset pods from the node without causing downtime or violating disruption constraints. 
     Below is the correct, production-safe way to drain a node.
      How to Safely Drain a Kubernetes Node
     Goal: Move workloads off the node cleanly before maintenance or shutdown.
     
     1. Mark the node as unschedulable
     This prevents new pods from being scheduled on it.
     kubectl cordon <node-name>
     Effect: The node is still running existing pods but will accept no new ones.
     
     
     2. Drain the node
     This evicts pods gracefully using Kubernetes eviction logic, respecting PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).
     kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
     Meaning of the flags:
     --ignore-daemonsets
     DaemonSet pods cannot be evicted, so they're ignored.
     
     --delete-emptydir-data
     Required if the node has pods using emptyDir volumes.
     
     Optional flags:
     --force
     Needed only if pods not managed by a controller (e.g., orphaned pods) are present.
     --grace-period=N
     Set a custom graceful shutdown time.

     5. Bring the node back
     When done:
     kubectl uncordon <node-name>
