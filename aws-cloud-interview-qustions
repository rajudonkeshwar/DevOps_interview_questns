1))) About CloudFront Distribution
Ans: 
 1. Signed URLs or Signed Cookies (Restrict by User Identity & Time)
    🔹 Two options:
    Signed URLs – Restrict access to specific files.
    Signed Cookies – Grant access to multiple files or an entire path.
    🔐 How it works:
    Create a CloudFront key pair under your AWS account.
    Use that key pair to sign URLs or cookies.
    Distribute the signed URL/cookie to users who are allowed access.
    CloudFront validates the signature and only serves content if valid.
    Use Cases:
    Pay-per-view content
    Temporary access to private files.

2.  Restrict Access by Geographic Location (Geo Restriction)
    Goal: Allow or block users based on their geographic location (country).
    Go to CloudFront → your distribution → Restrictions tab → Geo restriction.
    Choose “Allowlist” or “Blocklist” specific countries.

3. Restrict S3 Access Using Origin Access Control (OAC) or Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  🔹 Purpose:
  Prevent direct access to your S3 bucket content. Only CloudFront should be able to fetch and serve files.
  🔹 OAC (Origin Access Control) - Recommended
  A newer and more flexible way than OAI to securely allow CloudFront to access S3.
  🛠️ Steps to Implement OAC:
  Create a CloudFront distribution.
  Choose S3 as the origin.
  Enable Origin Access Control in the origin settings.
  Set the S3 bucket policy to allow access only from CloudFront via the OAC.
