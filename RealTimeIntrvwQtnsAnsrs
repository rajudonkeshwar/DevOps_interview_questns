1) How did you integrate prometheous in your project?
Ans:
    In our project, I set up Prometheus mainly for monitoring the application performance and infrastructure metrics.
     First i install prometheous on our servers, then i configure prometheous.yml, this file tells prometheous which targets
    to scrape.
    prometheous is agent based
    Consider two servers one is for prometheous, and another one is for node1
    i should install node-exporter agent in node1
    then i will configure time period in prometheous that once in every minute it should hit the node1 and it should pull the data
    and stores it in TSD, TSD is time series database which is one of the component of prometheous.

    There is something we call it as a node-exporter, if i want to fetch the data of the node from prometheous server
    i should install node-exporter as agent in the node it self, and give its credentials in prometheous.yml
    we can find targets information in prometheous.yaml

    And we have prometheous.yml file where we have scrape_configs option in which we include remote server identity
    such as ip address and labels

    thats how prometheous moniteris services

---------------------------

    To get the metrics dynamically from the nodes in to the server
