1) What is a Jenkins pipeline?
Ans: It is pack of plugins and intigarions of tools such as git, maven, sonar, docker, k8s  
that supports integrating and implementing continuous delivery pipelines using code.

2) What is the difference between freestyle project and pipeline?
Ans: Freestyle: UI-based and limited customization. Pipeline: Scripted and supports complex workflows as code.

1. Freestyle Project
A Freestyle Project in Jenkins is a simple, GUI-based job where you configure everything using forms and dropdowns.
🔹 Key Points:
Created using UI — no code needed.
You define steps like: source code checkout, build commands, test execution, and deployment manually in the Jenkins dashboard.
Easy to set up for simple CI/CD workflows.
Not easily portable or reusable — if you want to replicate it, you need to manually recreate or copy the job.
Harder to maintain for large or complex projects.

💡 Example:
A Freestyle project might pull code from GitHub, run a Maven build, and then deploy an artifact to a server — all configured through the Jenkins web interface.

2. Pipeline Project
A Pipeline Project uses code (Jenkinsfile) to define the entire CI/CD workflow in a script.
🔹 Key Points:
Pipeline as Code — everything (build, test, deploy) is written in a Jenkinsfile.
Stored inside the source code repository, making it version-controlled.
Supports complex workflows like parallel builds, approvals, error handling, and environment variables.
Easier to reuse and maintain, especially for large teams or multiple environments.
Allows Groovy-based scripting for more flexibility and automation.


4) What are the types of pipelines in Jenkins?
  ans: 
  1. Declarative Pipeline
  This is the most commonly used type.
  Uses a simplified and structured syntax (introduced later to make pipelines easier to write).
  Defined inside a pipeline { } block in a Jenkinsfile.
  Easier to read and maintain; best suited for most CI/CD use cases.

  2. Scripted Pipeline
  Uses Groovy scripting syntax (older and more flexible).
  Everything is written in a script { } block.
  Gives more control and logic (like loops, conditions, custom functions), but is more complex.
  Often used when you need advanced logic or dynamic behavior in your pipeline.

  3. Multibranch Pipeline
  Automatically creates and manages pipelines for each branch in your source control repository (e.g., GitHub).
  Each branch can have its own Jenkinsfile, allowing separate build/test configurations.
  Commonly used in Git-based CI/CD where multiple teams work on different branches.

5) what is jenkins pipeline?
ANS: A Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines the CI/CD pipeline as code. 
      It contains all the build, test, and deployment stages and is stored in the source code repository, 
      allowing version control and automation of the entire workflow.


6) Where is Jenkins installed?
Ans: Jenkins is usually installed on a Linux server or as a Docker container. 
      Its main home directory is /var/lib/jenkins, where all configurations, jobs, and plugins are stored.
      The JENKINS_HOME directory stores:

      Job configurations
      Plugins
      Jobs
      Build logs
      Pipeline scripts
      User and system settings


7) How do you configure a job in Jenkins?
Ans:
  A Jenkins job (or project) defines a set of tasks (like build, test, deploy) that Jenkins should execute. 
  You can configure it either through the UI (for Freestyle jobs) or through a Jenkinsfile (for Pipeline jobs).

  To configure a Jenkins job, go to the Jenkins dashboard, click “New Item,” choose the job type (Freestyle or Pipeline), 
  connect your source code repository, define build steps and triggers, then save and run the job. For advanced automation, 
   we use a Jenkinsfile to define everything as code.


   Login to Jenkins Dashboard
→ Open your Jenkins URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080)
→ Enter your credentials.

Create a New Job
→ Click on “New Item”
→ Enter a Job Name
→ Select “Freestyle project” (or “Pipeline” if you want code-based setup)
→ Click OK

Configure Source Code Management (SCM)
→ Under the Source Code Management section, select Git
→ Enter your repository URL and credentials.

Add Build Triggers (Optional)
→ You can choose how the job should start:

Build periodically (like a cron job)
Poll SCM (automatically build on code changes)
Build after another project

Add Build Steps
→ Under Build, click “Add build step”
→ Choose what you want Jenkins to do (e.g., “Execute shell”, “Invoke Gradle/Maven”, etc.)
→ Example: mvn clean package

Add Post-Build Actions
→ Configure what should happen after the build, like:

Publish artifacts
Send email notifications
Deploy to server
Save and Build
→ Click Save
→ Hit “Build Now”
→ You can check console output for logs and results.
